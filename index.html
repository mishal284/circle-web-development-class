        <p> <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong> Nelson mandela was born on 8 july 1918 in a small village called transkei in south Africa. He was a social rights activist, politician and philanthropist who became South Africa’s first Black president from 1994 to 1999. After becoming involved in the <strong>anti-apartheid</strong>  movement in his 20s, Mandela  joined the African National Congress in 1942. For 20 years, he directed a campaign of peaceful, nonviolent defiance against the South African government and its racist policies.Beginning in 1962, Mandela spent 27 years in prison for political offenses. In 1993, Mandela and South African President F.W. de Klerk were jointly awarded the <strong>Nobel peace Prize</strong> for their efforts to dismantle the country's apartheid system. For generations to come, Mandela will be a source of inspiration for civil rights activists worldwide. </p>
        <P> <strong> Made the struggles of his nation a worldwide phenomenon :  </strong> It was in the mid-1980s that the world slowly awakened to the suffering of the South Africans under apartheid rule. And even though Mandela was behind bars by then, as anti-apartheid rallies grew, so did awareness of Mandela’s struggle for freedom for black South Africans. His message was so powerful that a protest song named <strong> “Free Nelson Mandela”  </strong>  ,written and performed by the ska band 'Special AKA' after attending such a rally It was among the top ten hits in the UK, and became a legendary anthem worldwide. </P>
        <p> <strong>Contributed in Fight against HIV/AIDS :</strong> In 2000, it was found that a quarter of South African citizens between the ages of 15 and 45 tested positive for HIV/ AIDS. Nelson Mandela single-handedly set a new agenda for the future fight against HIV/AIDS with a groundbreaking speech in 2000 at an International AIDS conference in Durban. </p>
